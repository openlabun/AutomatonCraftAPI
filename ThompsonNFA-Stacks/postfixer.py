#In order to parse regular expressions by Thompson method, we need to convert them to postfix notation.
#Postfix notation is a mathematical notation in which the operators follow the number, 
#is a way of writing expressions without the need for parentheses.
#This is done by using the Shunting Yard Algorithm.

#This is an implementation of the Shunting Yard Algorithm to convert infix expressions
#to postfix expressions extracted from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting_yard_algorithm#The_algorithm_in_detail

#The algorithm is as follows:
#1. Read a token.
#2. If the token is a number (a symbol in our case), then add it to the output queue.
#3. If the token is an operator, then:
#    1. While there is an operator at the top of the operator stack with greater precedence:
#        1. Pop operators from the operator stack onto the output queue.
#    2. Push the current operator onto the operator stack.
#4. If the token is a left parenthesis, then push it onto the operator stack.
#5. If the token is a right parenthesis:
#    1. Until the token at the top of the operator stack is a left parenthesis, pop operators from the operator stack onto the output queue.
#    2. Pop the left parenthesis from the stack.
#    3. If the stack runs out without finding a left parenthesis, then there are mismatched parentheses.
#6. When there are no more tokens to read:
#    1. While there are still operator tokens on the stack:
#        1. If the operator token on the top of the stack is a parenthesis, then there are mismatched parentheses.
#        2. Pop the operator onto the output queue.
#7. Exit.

# First define the precedence of the operators and the operators themselves
# The higher the number, the higher the precedence
precedence = {
    '|': 1,
    '.': 2,
    '*': 3,
    '+': 3,
    '?': 3,
    '(': 4,
    ')': 4,
}

# Define the operators
operators = ['|', '.', '*', '+', '?', '(', ')']
